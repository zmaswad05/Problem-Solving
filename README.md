# Problem-Solving

I've successfully tackled over 300 problems covering a wide range of concepts, including strings, arrays, dates, and numerous others.


“### Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) in Software Engineering **By: Zuheir Asvad B2205.090031** * * * ### Hazards and Problems #### 1\. Ergonomic Hazards * **Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs):** Long typing sessions can cause conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome. * **Eye Strain:** Extended screen use can lead to digital eye strain. * **Poor Posture:** An improper workstation setup can lead to pain in the back, neck, and shoulders. #### 2\. Psychosocial Hazards * **Stress:** Heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and demanding projects can cause significant stress and burnout. * **Isolation:** Working remotely can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. #### 3\. Physical Hazards * **Electrical Hazards:** Exposure to electronic equipment and power supply problems can present risks. #### 4\. Data Security * **Cybersecurity Threats:** Dealing with sensitive data can potentially expose employees to cyber-attacks and breaches. * * * ### Preventative Measures #### 1\. Ergonomic Workstations * **Utilization of Adjustable Furniture:** Employ adjustable chairs, desks, and monitor stands to maintain proper posture. * **Encouragement of Frequent Breaks:** Promote regular breaks to alleviate strain on the eyes and muscles. * **Integration of Ergonomic Accessories:** Incorporate ergonomic keyboards, mice, and footrests to enhance comfort and reduce strain. #### 2\. Stress Management * **Workload Management:** Introduce achievable deadlines and manageable workloads. * **Support Systems:** Offer access to mental health resources and counseling services. * **Work-Life Balance:** Advocate for policies that foster a healthy balance between professional and personal life. #### 3\. Physical Safety * **Regular Maintenance:** Ensure that all electrical equipment undergoes routine inspection and maintenance. * **Safety Training:** Provide employees with education on the safe operation of electronic devices and emergency protocols. #### 4\. Data Security * **Cybersecurity Training:** Offer regular training on data security practices and emerging threats. * **Secure Systems:** Implement robust security measures to safeguard sensitive data. * * * By addressing these hazards and implementing the suggested preventative measures, software engineering environments can become safer and more conducive to both productivity and employee well-being.”
